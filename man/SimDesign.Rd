\details{
This package provides tools to help organize Monte Carlo simulations in R.
The tools provided control the structure and back-end of the Monte Carlo simulations
by utilizing a generate-analyse-summerise strategy. The package
attempts to handle issues such as re-simulating non-convergent results,
supports parallel back-end computations, saves and restores temporary files,
aggregates results across independent nodes, and provides native support for debugging.
The primary function for
organizing the simulations is \code{\link{runSimulation}}.
