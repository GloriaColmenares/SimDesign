Description: Functions to organize Monte Carlo simulations in R. Tries to manage the structure
             and back-end Monte Carlo simulations, managing issues like resimulating
             non-convergent results, organizing the functional workflow through a
             generate -> analyse -> summerise stragegy, handling parallel back-end information,
             saving and restoring temporary files, and so on.
