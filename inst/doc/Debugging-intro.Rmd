# Debugging/editing, and passing further arguments to runSimulation()

Talk about debugging, and how the package makes debugging really easy.

### Debugging with the `edit` argument

Pass `edit = 'fun_name'` to enter debuger. Formally equivalent to using `debug(fun_name)`, but slightly more 
convientient.

### Debugging with `browser()`

This can be placed anywhere in the respective functions. Parallel computing will automatically be disabled 
while a `browser()` is visible within the code.
