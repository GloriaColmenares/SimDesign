# Parameter recovery of secondary estimates

In some situations in may be useful to track information other than the data generated from `generate`. The
example demonstrated in this working file relates to recovering latent trait score (also known as factor
scores or abilities) from item response theory models. The focus here is how various test characteristics
and estimation methods affect the precision of the $N$ recovered estimates. The difference between this and
other simulations is that, in addition to analysing and tracking the data generated from `generate`, we also
want to track information that was used to generate said data (i.e., the latent trait scores).

### Define conditions

To keep this example simple, we will only investigate the effects of varying the number of items in the test
and population distribution of the latent traits. 
All other parameters will be sampled from some internal generating functions in R. 

```{r}
test_length <- c(10, 20, 30)
distribution <- c('normal', 'bimodal')
Design <- expand.grid(test_length=test_length, distribution=distribution)
```

### Define the functions

As usual, define the functions of interest. Here we make sure that `mirt` is loaded in when required.

```{r}
library(SimDesign)
# SimDesign_functions()
```

```{r}
Generate <- function(condition) {
    
    library(mirt) #for simdata() function
    nitems <- condition$test_length
    N <- 300
        
    #source in for convience (otherwise, these could be manually define in the source code)
    a <- matrix(rlnorm(nitems, .2, .3))
    d <- matrix(rnorm(nitems, 0, .5))
    
    if(condition$distribution == 'normal'){
        Theta <- matrix(scale(rnorm(N)))
    } else if(condition$distribution == 'bimodal'){
        Theta <- scale(c(rnorm(N/2, 1, 0.5), rnorm(N/2, -1, 0.5)))
    }
    dat <- simdata(a=a, d=d, Theta=Theta, itemtype = 'dich')
    
    ret <- list(dat=dat, parameters=list(Theta=Theta, a=a, d=d))
    ret
}

Analyse <- function(condition, dat, parameters = NULL) {
    
    library(mirt)
    
    # assign population values for complete model
    sv <- mirt(dat, 1, pars = 'values')
    sv$value[sv$name == 'a1'] <- parameters$a
    sv$value[sv$name == 'd'] <- parameters$d
    mod <- mirt(dat, 1, pars = sv, TOL = NaN)
    
    EAPscore <- fscores(mod, full.scores=TRUE)
    MAPscore <- fscores(mod, method = 'MAP', full.scores=TRUE)
    MLscore <- fscores(mod, method = 'ML', full.scores=TRUE)
    
    ret <- list(EAP=EAPscore, MAP=MAPscore, ML=MLscore)
    ret
}

Summarise <- function(condition, results, parameters_list = NULL) {
    index <- 1:length(results)
    diff_EAP <- do.call(c, lapply(index, function(ind, obs, pop) obs[[ind]]$EAP - pop[[ind]]$Theta,
                   obs=results, pop=parameters_list))
    diff_MAP <- do.call(c, lapply(index, function(ind, obs, pop) obs[[ind]]$MAP - pop[[ind]]$Theta, 
                   obs=results, pop=parameters_list))
    diff_ML <- do.call(c, lapply(index, function(ind, obs, pop) obs[[ind]]$ML - pop[[ind]]$Theta, 
                   obs=results, pop=parameters_list))
    diff_ML <- diff_ML[is.finite(diff_ML)]
    
    bias_EAP <- bias(diff_EAP)
    bias_MAP <- bias(diff_MAP)
    bias_ML <- bias(diff_ML)
    RMSE_EAP <- RMSE(diff_EAP)
    RMSE_MAP <- RMSE(diff_MAP)
    RMSE_ML <- RMSE(diff_ML)
    
    ret <- c(bias_EAP=bias_EAP, bias_MAP=bias_MAP, bias_ML=bias_ML,
             RMSE_EAP=RMSE_EAP, RMSE_MAP=RMSE_MAP, RMSE_ML=RMSE_ML)
    ret
}
```

### Run the simulation

The following function calls should be familar to you by now. 

```{r cache=TRUE}
result <- runSimulation(Design, replications = 100, parallel = TRUE,
                       generate=Generate, analyse=Analyse, summarise=Summarise)
```

```{r}
print(result)
```

### Analyze the results

When the $\theta$ estimates were generate from a normal distribution it appeared that all 
latent trait estimates were fairly 
unbiased across random $\theta$ sets, however ML estimation provided the 
highest RMSE (this is reasonable, because the Bayesian estimates selected a good prior). 
As the test length increased, all estimates improved in their overall precision to recover 
the population parameters, which makes sense
given that longer tests provide more information about an individuals' ability. 

When the distribution of the $\theta$'s were bimodal the same effect occured, however for the EAP estimates
the overall RMSE was actually slightly *less* than when the correct prior was provided for 
the population (the default in *mirt* is $N(0,1)$). 
ML estimates were largely unaffected by altering the distribution, mainly because estimates
are not influenced by prior beliefs.

Note that this analysis was about population effects *across all sampled ability levels*. In general, these 
estimators may perform differently for specific abilities (i.e., ML estimation may do much worse as $|\theta|$
becomes larger) and when different priors are used. Depending on what the focus of the Monte Carlo study is, 
this topic may be of more importance than overall bias and RMSE (see the *mirtCAT* package and the associated 
JSS paper for further details on this aspect of IRT models).
